A package to allow the Invisible Higgs samples to decay with Pythia.


To compile :
  $ export EXTERNAL=<path to HepMC>
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$EXTERNAL/lib
  $ make



To run the executable:
  $ ./decaylhe

NB:
	LHEinfo.sh is a script that returns the number of events stored per lhe. It requires the LHE as an argument.

NB:	
	The Higgs decay H-> Z Z is known to Pythia with the decay mode number: 225
	The Z decay Z -> v v is known to Pythia with the decay mode number:  183/ 185/ 187 for electrons, muon & tau neutrinos

	The PDG ID for the Higgs= 25
          	    	 Z boson= 23
		      e neutrino= 12
	             mu neutrino= 14
	            tau neutrino= 16
